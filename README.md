Level Ground MMA is an landing page that was built for Level Ground MMA, a  mixed martial arts studio based in Boston, Maasachusetts. They were in need of a new landing page to showcase the studio and I was contacted to create a brand new website.

## Lessons Learned:

There are many lessons I've learned during this process. To cater to my client's requests, I've learned many different CSS tricks, styles, and techniques. The biggest lesson I learned was how to master responsive site design. Prior to building this project I had trouble with making a website responsive across various devices, but now, I've mastered how to make a website responsive across all devices.
